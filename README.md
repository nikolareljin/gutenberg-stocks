This plugin uses __Alphavantage API__ service for historical stock data retrieval:

__Note :__ Alphavantage API allows 4 requests per minute in the Free API service so using more than that number of requests will result in an error.  


Please get your API token before activating the plugin.

## Compile React components

Install NPM dependencies

`npm install`

## ðŸ‘‰  `npm start`
- Use to compile and run the block in development mode.
- Watches for any changes and reports back any errors in your code.

## ðŸ‘‰  `npm run build`
- Use to build production code for your block inside `dist` folder.
- Runs once and reports back the gzip file sizes of the produced code.

## ðŸ‘‰  `npm run eject`
- Use to eject your plugin out of `create-guten-block`.
- Provides all the configurations so you can customize the project as you want.
- It's a one-way street, `eject` and you have to maintain everything yourself.
- You don't normally have to `eject` a project because by ejecting you lose the connection with `create-guten-block` and from there onwards you have to update and maintain all the dependencies on your own.


### React Stock Charts
This project uses React Stock Charts to render the time series: http://rrag.github.io/react-stockcharts/documentation.html#/svg_vs_canvas
